Video in, events out. Never reads simulator data at runtime.

1. Detect players and ball (YOLO)
2. Assign teams by shirt color
3. Track identities across frames
4. Map pixels to pitch meters (homography)
5. Possession = nearest player to the ball
6. Rules turn possession changes into events (`source: cv`)

Accuracy is measured afterward against the simulator's true events.
